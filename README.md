# emm2311-final

In this final assignment, we were tasked to create a basic personal 1006 homepage (webiste) in HTML in which we were to provide our name, current grade, intended major, a picture of yourselves, a link to our favorite webiste, and two separate pages of our own choosing. For the additional two pages, I chose the option of writing one page about all of the assignments from this course and explain which one was my favorite and the other page about the classes I took this spring, and explain which one was my favorite. From this assignment, I learned how to do some basic functions in HTML, such as creating headers, making hyperlinks with pages that are public and are of my own making, print text, and add images.
