     <h1>Assignments from ENGIE1006</h1>
     <p>Here are the summaries of the assignments from ENGIE1006:</p>
     <p>Homework 01: In Part a, we were assigned some theory-based problems where we wrote some pseudocode, did some conversions with Positive Binary, Signed Binary, One's Complement, Two's Complement, and Octal, wrote an algorithm for a word problem, and completed a table determining if a combination of true and false in a particular arrangement returned true or false. In Part b, we were assigned to do some basic coding involving giving information from a user's input(s) and manipulations of lists, which helped in understanding how a program should be structured to keep organized.</p>
     <p>Homework 02: In Part a, we primarily worked with iterations, where we provided the state of a list after each iteration, applied sequential search to a phone book with 10,000 names, and found the time complexity of an algorithm. In Part b, we created a code that simulated projectile motion without the assumption of gravity staying constant as the projectile object changes altitudes and then compared what we got from the simulation to the assumed constant gravity function by plotting them in the same graph.</p>
     <p>Homework 03: In Part a, we wrote pseudocode and found the time complexity of set operations and used recursion to implement given functions. In Part b, we created a percolation module to solve the vertical percolation problem by using numpy arrays and created methods that analyze a data set in which give the amount of rows and columns of the dataset, reports how many of the reported entries were benign and how many were malignant, modifies the dataset by stripping the client ID and converting the float columns to floats from strings, and splitting the dataset such that a given percentage of the total entries as were returned as the testng part and the remaining as the training part.</p>
     <p>Homework 04: In this assignment, we modeled a classroom, where we generated and enrolled students, calculated and distributed grades, paid the teacher given the difficulty of the assignments and the amount of students enrolled, and plotted the data from the course. The purpose of this assignment was to get comfortable with an object-oriented codebase and reading and interpreting error messages to fill in the missing details.</p>
     <p>Homework 05: In this assignment, we completed our machine learning library by using pandas to provide statistics, such as the skewness and kurtosis of each column and the mean and standard deviation of each column after it has been group into benign or malignant, of the dataset, plotting a pairplot of each column against other columns and a heatmap of the columns correlations using seaborad, implementing the K nearest neighbors algorithm, and using scikit-learn to implement K nearest neighbors for comparison and for the Support Vector Machine classifier, which gave us the accuracy of our reported data. The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize ourselves with how to utilize pandas to analyze data, plot more advanced information using seaboard, implementing the K nearest neighbor algorithm, and using scikit-learn.</p>
     <p>My favorite homework assignment from this course was Homework 02 Part b enjoyed applying coding to simulate a more accurate calculation of projectile motion. I felt that I had a connection to this assignment because in my physics classes, I felt somewhat cheated for not accounting that gravity changes as altitude changes, but from doing this assignment, it has put me somewhat at ease to know that the difference of the results between the simulation and the formulas we use in physics classes are not as drastic as I would have thought. However, I find knowing how to more accurately predict how projectile objects move very cool and fun.</p>
